Comparative analysis of machine learning models for predicting injury severity in mountain accidents

Master's thesis

The rising popularity of mountain tourism is associated with an increased number of accidents, posing a challenge for rescue services. This study focuses on a comparative analysis of machine learning models in the context of predicting injury severity in mountain accidents. The primary aim of the research was to design and optimize an analytical tool capable of accurately forecasting the severity of injuries sustained by victims. The study utilized data collected by the Polish Mountain Search and Rescue (GOPR) from 2020 to 2024, comprising information on 9578 incidents. The study included preliminary data processing and analysis, identification of significant variables influencing injury severity, and the construction and evaluation of various classification models. Methods such as Spearman rank correlation, SMOTE, RFECV, TOPSIS, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Trees, Support Vector Machines, and hard and soft voting classifiers were employed. The models were compared based on indicators such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1 score, ROC curve, and AUC. The analysis demonstrated that the Gradient Boosting Trees model exhibited the highest accuracy (67%) in predicting injury severity, with particular emphasis on fatal accidents. The analysis of significant variables revealed that factors such as the type of accident, cause of the accident, and duration of the rescue operation have the greatest impact on injury severity. This study provides valuable insights into the application of machine learning models in mountain rescue operations and highlights key variables that should be considered in the decision-making process. The findings enable the formulation of recommendations aimed at improving data collection, facilitating the assessment of injury severity by rescuers, and developing more precise preventive strategies and public policies related to mountain safety.

The data used in the paper comes from mountain accident cards from seven GOPR regional groups, collected in 2020-2024 (as of 05.03.2024). They contain information on 9578 incidents that took place in the area of operation of the Mountain Volunteer Rescue Service Rescue Service. Each record contained information on: ˙

- the regional group in which the incident occurred,
- the time of the report,
- the month of the incident,
- the phase of the week (end of the week or working days),
- location of the incident,
- the place of duty of rescuers dispatched to the action, ˙ the
- number of rescuers involved in the action,
- the cause of the accident,
- type of accident,
- the altitude of the accident site (whether the incident took place above 1,500 meters above sea level), ˙ whether rescuers were dispatched or contacted themselves.
- whether the rescuers were dispatched or contacted the Emergency Notification Center themselves. Emergency Services,
- the age of the victim,
- the type of transport/evacuation of the casualty from the scene,
- weather,
- gender of the victim,
- the duration of the action,
- injuries of the victim
